# Deep learning libraries

There are many deep learning libraries available. Some of them are more general, while others are more specific. In this section, we will see some of the most popular libraries.

## PyTorch

From a research perspective, PyTorch is one of the most popular deep learning libraries. It is a Python library that provides a wide range of tools to build and train deep learning models. It is also the library used in this book. PyTorch is based on the Torch library, which is a scientific computing framework with wide support for machine learning algorithms. PyTorch is developed by Facebook's AI Research lab (FAIR) and since September 2022, [it is a Linux Foundation project](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/blog/blog/welcoming-pytorch-to-the-linux-foundation).

PyTorch is a Python library that allows you to build and train deep learning models. Some of the core concepts of PyTorch are:
- **Tensors**: Tensors are the core data structure of PyTorch. They are similar to NumPy arrays, but they can be used on GPUs to accelerate computing.
- **Autograd**: PyTorch provides automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors. This means that you can compute gradients automatically. Namely, you can compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the model.
- **Neural networks**: PyTorch provides a wide range of neural network layers and activation functions. It also provides a way to build neural networks using the `nn.Module` class (similarly to what we have seen in the previous chapters).
- **Optimizers**: PyTorch provides a wide range of optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, RMSProp, etc.
- **Data loaders**: PyTorch provides a way to load data in batches. This is useful when you have a large dataset and you want to train your model on a GPU.
- **GPU support**: PyTorch provides GPU support for all operations on Tensors. This means that you can train your model on a GPU and get faster results.
- **Distributed training**: PyTorch provides a way to train your model on multiple GPUs or multiple machines. This is useful when you have a large dataset and you want to train your model on multiple GPUs or multiple machines.

### Tensors

A tensor is a generalization of vectors and matrices. A tensor is a multidimensional array. For example, a vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, and a 3-dimensional tensor is a 3-dimensional array. In PyTorch, tensors are represented by the `torch.Tensor` class. The `torch.Tensor` class is similar to the NumPy `ndarray` class. However, the `torch.Tensor` class provides GPU support for all operations on tensors. This means that you can perform operations on tensors on a GPU and get faster results.

```{code-block} python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
# shape: (2, 3)
print(x.shape)
# dtype: torch.int64
print(x.dtype)
# device: cpu
print(x.device)

# Create a tensor on GPU
x = torch.tensor([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]], device='cuda') # you can use mps on modern MacBooks
# ...
```

### Autograd

When you train a deep learning model, you need to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the model. This is called backpropagation. PyTorch provides automatic differentiation for all operations on tensors. What this means is that you can compute gradients automatically. For example, if you have a tensor `x` and you want to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to `x`, you can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch

# only complex or float tensors can have gradients
# requires_grad=True means that we want to compute gradients
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], requires_grad=True, dtype=torch.float32) 
y = x ** 2
z = y.sum()
z.backward() # compute gradients
print(x.grad) # gradients of z with respect to x
```

This is useful when you want to train a deep learning model. The gradients are computed automatically, so you don't have to backpropagate them manually. Autograd works by keeping track of all operations on tensors. When you call `backward()` on a tensor, autograd computes the gradients of the loss function with respect to the tensor. This is done by using the chain rule. 

### Neural networks

The `torch.nn` module provides a wide range of neural network layers and activation functions. Convolutional, Transformer, Pooling... layers are available. 
One of the most important classes in the `torch.nn` module is the `nn.Module` class. This class is used to build neural networks. It provides a way to define the forward pass of the neural network. The forward pass is the process of computing the output of the neural network given an input. The `nn.Module` class also provides a way to define the backward pass of the neural network. The backward pass is the process of computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network. In most cases, you don't need to define the backward pass manually so you can inherit from the `nn.Module` class and define the forward pass only.

```{code-block} python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.linear = nn.Linear(10, 1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.relu(x)
        return x
```

### Optimizers and Schedulers

The optimizer of a neural network is the algorithm that is used to update the parameters of the neural network. The most popular optimizer is the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer. It is used to update the parameters of the neural network by computing the gradients of the loss function with respect to the parameters of the neural network and then updating the parameters of the neural network using the gradients. PyTorch provides a wide range of optimizers, such as SGD, Adam, AdamW, RMSProp, etc. 

```{code-block} python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
```

The optimizer takes as input the parameters of the neural network and the learning rate. The learning rate is a hyperparameter that controls how much the parameters of the neural network are updated.
Most of the times, however, you don't want a constant learning rate. You want to [adjust the learning rate during training](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/optim.html#how-to-adjust-learning-rate). This is done by using a learning rate scheduler. PyTorch provides a wide range of learning rate schedulers, such as StepLR, MultiStepLR, ExponentialLR, etc.
For example, if we want to decrease the learning rate by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs, we can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

model = nn.Linear(10, 1)
optimizer = torch.optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
scheduler = torch.optim.lr_scheduler.StepLR(optimizer, step_size=10, gamma=0.1)
```

💡 When using optimizers and schedulers, it is important to include them in the training loop. Each object has a `step()` method that should be called after each batch. For example:

```{code-block} python

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        # ...
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        scheduler.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
```

❓ Why do we need to call `optimizer.zero_grad()` after each batch?
When we compute the gradients using `loss.backward()`, the gradients are accumulated in the parameters of the neural network. Those gradients are used in `optimizer.step()` to update the parameters of the neural network. 
Next time we call `loss.backward()`, the gradients are accumulated in the parameters of the neural network again. This means that the gradients are accumulated over and over at each batch. This is not what we want. Instead, we want to compute the gradients for each batch and then update the parameters of the neural network. After that, we want to reset the gradients to zero so that the gradients are not accumulated over and over at each batch. This is done by calling `optimizer.zero_grad()`.

### Datasets and DataLoaders

When training a deep learning model, you need to load the data to feed it to the model. In almost all cases, you don't want to feed a single example to the model. Instead, you want to use a batch of examples. This is done by using data loaders. `Dataset` and `DataLoader` are two classes that allow data manipulation in PyTorch. 

Detailed explainations of `Dataset` and `DataLoader` are available in the [CNN chapter](./2_cnns.md). Hereafter we provide a brief summary of the two classes.

The `Dataset` class is used to load the data from the dataset. It is designed to provide a way to load the data from the dataset and to transform the data. The `DataLoader` class is used to load the data from the `Dataset` class. It provides a unified interface to divide the data into batches and to load the data from the `Dataset` class. 

```{admonition} Exercise, 30 min
:class: exercise
Select a dataset that is useful for your research. If you don't have a dataset, you can use the [German Emotional-TTS dataset](https://www.openslr.org/110/) that contains 300 identical sentences spoken by a single speaker in 8 different emotions (2.400 recordings in total for 175 minutes of speech).

👀 **Hint**: You can download the folder by executing the following command in your terminal: `wget https://www.openslr.org/resources/110/thorsten-emotional_v02.tgz`

Create a `Dataset` class that loads the data from the dataset. Then, create a `DataLoader` class that loads the data from the `Dataset` class. 
```

### GPU support

PyTorch provides GPU support for all operations on tensors. This means that you can perform operations on tensors on a GPU and get faster results. To use a GPU, you need to create a tensor on a GPU. This is done by using the `device` argument of the `torch.tensor` function. For example, if you want to create a tensor on a GPU, you can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch

x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3], device='cuda')
```

To benchmark the speed of a GPU we can run the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch
import time
x = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device='cuda')
y = torch.randn(10000, 10000, device='cuda')
start = time.time()
for i in range(10):
    z = x @ y
end = time.time()

gpu_time = end - start
print(f"10 x GEMM on GPU: {gpu_time} seconds")

x = torch.randn(10000, 10000)
y = torch.randn(10000, 10000)
start = time.time()
for i in range(10):
    z = x @ y
end = time.time()
cpu_time = end - start
print(f"10 x GEMM on CPU: {cpu_time} seconds")

print(f"GPU speedup: {cpu_time / gpu_time}")
# GEMM stands for General Matrix Multiplication
```

PyTorch does not support only NVIDIA GPUs. It also supports modern MacBooks with Apple Silicon. You can use the `device='mps'` argument to use the Apple Silicon GPU.

### Distributed training

When dealing with large models and large datasets, it is often necessary to train the model on multiple GPUs. PyTorch provides a way to train your model on multiple GPUs. This is done by using the `torch.nn.DataParallel` class. This class allows you to train your model on multiple GPUs by splitting the batch into multiple batches and then computing the gradients on each GPU. For example, if you have a batch of size 64 and you want to train your model on 2 GPUs, you can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

# ... define model ...
if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
    device = torch.device('cuda')
    model = nn.DataParallel(model) # replicate model to multiple GPUs

# ... create data loader ...
for batch in data_loader:
    # device management will be done automatically
    input = batch['input'].to(device) # send input to GPU
    target = batch['target'].to(device)
    output = model(input)
    # ... compute loss ...
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    optimizer.zero_grad()

# save model
# without DataParallel
# torch.save(model.state_dict(), 'model.pt')
# with DataParallel
torch.save(model.module.state_dict(), 'model.pt')
```

PyTorch also provides a way to train your model on multiple machines (DDP). This is done by using the `torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel` class. This class allows you to train your model on a single machine with multiple GPUs or multiple machines with multiple GPUs. However, it requires more setup than the `torch.nn.DataParallel` class. For example, if you want to train your model on 2 machines with 2 GPUs each, you can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.distributed as dist
import torch.multiprocessing as mp

def main():
    # ... define model ...
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
        mp.spawn(train, nprocs=torch.cuda.device_count(), args=(model,))
    else:
        train(0, model)

def train(gpu, model):
    rank = gpu
    dist.init_process_group(backend='nccl', init_method='env://', world_size=4, rank=rank)
    torch.cuda.set_device(gpu)
    model = model.to(gpu)
    ddp_model = nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(model, device_ids=[gpu])
    # ... create data loader ...
    for batch in data_loader:
        input = batch['input'].to(gpu)
        target = batch['target'].to(gpu)
        output = ddp_model(input)
        # ... compute loss ...
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The setup is more complicated than the `torch.nn.DataParallel` class because you need to initialize the process group and set the device manually. This process is designed for more advanced use-cases. If you are interested in distributed training, you may want to take a look at [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/), a library that both simplifies and extends PyTorch's capabilities. PyTorch Lightning is beyond the scope of this book, and you can contact the teacher if you want to learn more about it.

## HuggingFace Transformers

[HuggingFace Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) is a Python library that provides state-of-the-art models for a variety of domains, including NLP, Computer Vision and Speech Processing. As can be inferred from the name, the library mostly include transformer-based models.

The library is built on top of PyTorch (with some models also implemented in TensorFlow and JAX) and provides a unified API to use the models. The library allows the use of pre-trained models that can be found on the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models). 


```{figure} images/4_libraries/huggingface.png

width: 100%
name: hf_hub
alt: hf_hub

Screenshot of the HuggingFace Model Hub
```

As of January 2024, the hub includes almost 500.000 models (both pre-trained and fine-tuned) and is growing fast. It is possible to **load** pre-trained models, **train** new models, **evaluate** models and **share** models.

Depending on the model and the task, the library provides different classes and methods. However, the general workflow is the same for all models. The following code shows how to load a pre-trained model and use it to generate text:

```{code-block} python
import torch
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification, AutoFeatureExtractor

model_name = "facebook/wav2vec2-base" # identifier of the model
model = Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name) # load the model
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name) # load the feature extractor

sample_audio = torch.randn(16000) # 1 second of audio sampled at 16kHz
input_values = feature_extractor(sample_audio, sampling_rate=16000, return_tensors="pt").input_values # extract features

outputs = model(input_values) # forward pass
logits = outputs.logits # get logits
```

Most of the parameters are initialized by **default**, so it is suggested to carefully read the documentation of the model you want to use. For example, in the previous code, the classification **head** is initialized with 2 classes (positive and negative). If you want to use a different number of classes, you need to change the `num_labels` parameter.

```{code-block} python
import torch
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification, AutoFeatureExtractor

model_name = "facebook/wav2vec2-base" # identifier of the model
model = Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3) # load the model
feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(model_name) # load the feature extractor

sample_audio = torch.randn(16000) # 1 second of audio sampled at 16kHz
input_values = feature_extractor(sample_audio, sampling_rate=16000, return_tensors="pt").input_values # extract features

outputs = model(input_values) # forward pass
logits = outputs.logits # get logits (shape: (1, 3))
```

Pre-trained models, in most cases, can be used as `nn.Module` objects. This means that you can use them in the same way you use PyTorch models. For example, you can train them using the `nn.Module` class and the `torch.optim` module. 

```{code-block} python
import torch
from transformers import Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification, AutoFeatureExtractor

model_name = "facebook/wav2vec2-base" # identifier of the model
model = Wav2Vec2ForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name, num_labels=3) # load the model

# ... create data loader ...

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-4)
for batch in data_loader:
    input_values = batch['input_values']
    outputs = model(input_values) # forward pass
    loss = outputs.loss # get loss
    loss.backward() # compute gradients
    optimizer.step() # update parameters
    optimizer.zero_grad() # reset gradients
```

It is **suggested** to extract features in the `__get_item__` method of the `Dataset` class, or in the `data_collator` of the `DataLoader` class. This is because the feature extraction is usually computationally *expensive*, thus parallelizing it is a good idea. 

```{code-block} python
import torch
import torchaudio

class MyDataset(torch.utils.data.Dataset):
    def __init__(self, paths, labels):
        self.paths = paths
        self.labels = labels
        self.feature_extractor = AutoFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base")

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        path = self.paths[idx]
        label = self.labels[idx]
        audio, sr = torchaudio.load(path)
        # ... resample, normalize, etc ...
        features = self.feature_extractor(audio, sampling_rate=self.feature_extractor.sampling_rate, return_tensors="pt").input_values
        return {
            "input_values": features,
            "labels": label
        }
```

The library also provides a `Trainer` class that automate most of the training process. However, the simplicity comes at the cost of flexibility, thus to do non-standard training, it is suggested to implement the training loop manually. Using the trainer class is beyond the scope of this book, but you can find more information [here](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/trainer.html).

```{admonition} Exercise, 40 min
:class: exercise

Select a model from the [Model Hub](https://huggingface.co/models) that is useful for your research. Use the Dataset you created in the previous exercise to fine-tune the model (e.g., for classification).

Implement a complete training setup, inclusing training, validation and testing. You can set standard parameters (e.g., batch size, learning rate, etc.) for educational purposes. However, you are encouraged to experiment with different parameters and to use a validation set to select the best model.
```

## Model monitoring and visualization

When training a deep learning model, it is important to monitor the training process. There exist many tools to monitor the training process:
- [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard)
- [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
- [Comet](https://www.comet.ml/site/)
- [Neptune](https://neptune.ai/)
- ... and many more

In this section, we will see how to use Comet to monitor the training process. It is an online platform that allows you to monitor specific metrics during training.

### Comet

To use Comet, you need to create an account on the [website](https://www.comet.ml/site/). **Note**: Comet is free for academic use. Once you have created an account, you can install the Python library by executing the following command in your terminal:

```{code-block} bash
pip install comet-ml
```

Then, you can use the library to log metrics during training. For example, if you want to log the loss during training, you can do it with the following code:

```{code-block} python
from comet_ml import Experiment

# ... create model ...
experiment = Experiment(
    api_key="your_api_key",
    workspace="your_workspace", 
    project_name="your_project_name"
)

for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in data_loader:
        # ... forward pass ...
        loss = ...
        experiment.log_metric("loss", loss)
```

Hereafter we explain each parameter of the `Experiment` class:
- `api_key`: This is the API key that you can find on the [website](https://www.comet.ml/site/). You can also find it in the settings of your account.
- `workspace`: This is the name of your workspace. Usually, it is your username.
- `project_name`: This is the name of your project. If the project does not exist, it will be created automatically (e.g., `project_name="DL4SV-course"`).

⚠️ It is strongly suggested to **not** hard-code the API key in your code. Instead, you can use environment variables. For example, you can use the following code:

```{code-block} python
import os
from comet_ml import Experiment

experiment = Experiment(
    api_key=os.environ["COMET_API_KEY"],
    workspace=os.environ["COMET_WORKSPACE"], 
    project_name="DL4SV-course"
)
```

To set the environment variables, you can use the following commands in your terminal:

```{code-block} bash
export COMET_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export COMET_WORKSPACE="your_workspace"
```

or you can add them to your `~/.bashrc` file to be loaded automatically at the lauch of a new terminal.

Once your training/evaluation is running, you can go to the [website](https://www.comet.ml/site/) and see the metrics evolving in real-time.

```

There are additional and more advanced features that you can use. For example, you can log images, audio, text, etc. You can also log hyperparameters and tags. You can find more information [here](https://www.comet.ml/docs/python-sdk/Experiment/).

```{admonition} Exercise, 15 min
:class: exercise

Modify the code of the previous exercise to log the loss during training. You can also log the validation loss and the accuracy.
```

# Summary
